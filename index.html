<p>The process of setting up an I2P update server, complete with I2P torrents for updates, is surprisingly straightforward, but there isn’t really a document where every step is laid out from end-to-end. Having done it a couple times, I suppose I’m the apt person to write such a document, with the proposed target being a dev build that you host yourself or for a small audience of testers.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-get-started">What you need to get started:</h2>
<ul>
<li>An I2P router installed on your system.</li>
<li><code>python3</code> and <code>bash</code> for generating the news feeds</li>
<li>Virtualenv or Docker to isolate the feed generator dependencies(optional but a good idea)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="setting-up-your-signing-keys">Setting up your Signing Keys</h3>
<p>In order to distribute updates, you should set up signing keys in order to authenticate the downloads. It’s also important in order to carry out the whole process, end-to-end, in order to understand how it all works. In order to generate your plugin signing keys, use the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download the helper script. This wraps around some of the key generation options to make them easier to use. The helper script is available <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eyedeekay/Generate-Plugin-Signing-Keys/master/i2pk">at this link</a> and can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/eyedeekay/Generate-Plugin-Signing-Keys/">on my github</a>.</li>
<li>Generate your newsfeed signing keys by running the following command from the directory where you downloaded <code>i2pk</code>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="ex">./i2pk</span> -p <span class="va">$HOME</span>/i2p-dev-keys <span class="kw">\</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>        <span class="ex">-s</span> you@mail.i2p <span class="kw">\</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>        <span class="ex">-t</span> RSA_SHA512_4096 <span class="kw">\</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>        <span class="ex">-n</span> newssigner <span class="kw">\</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>        <span class="ex">-c</span> router generate_keys</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="fu">cp</span> ~/i2p/certificates/router/you_at_mail.i2p ~/i2p/certificates/news/you_at_mail.i2p</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And you’re all done. Your new signing keys are ready to use for both <code>news</code> and <code>router</code> updates on your own system. These updates will not work for people who do not choose to trust your keys.</p>
